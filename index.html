      <h1>Mapping Community Safety: Building Visualization Resources for Domestic Violence Advocacy</h1>
      <h3>As researchers in Human-Centered Design & Engineering, we set out to explore how data visualization can support people who have experienced Domestic Violence. In collaboration with King County Bar Association and other partners in the community, we begin by creating a visual map of the process of navigating Domestic Violence Protection Orders in King County.</h3>

      What would it look like if we imagined a justice system that helps us feel safe without creating new wounds in our communities? One that the most vulnerable among us can navigate and through which they can find support? One where we can hold each other accountable while maintaining a sense of shared humanity and empathy/care for those who have caused harm?</p>
      
      <p>This radical, ambitious work is what we’re setting out to explore with the Mapping Community Safety project. Specifically, we’re designing visuals and other tools to support and build out interventions in cases of domestic violence (DV).</p>
      
      <b>who we are</b>
      <p>We are researchers in human-centered design who specialize in information visualization and collaborative design. We are also advocates who have spent years in legal services and domestic violence/sexual assault domains, and we are approaching the Mapping Community Safety project with our experience in all of these spheres. In particular, we carry with us a sensitivity to the risks of physical harm and retraumatization for people who have or are experiencing DV. We aim to utilize the exploratory and rhetorical power of visualization to support advocates, lawyers, and law enforcement officials in sustaining the work they do on a day-to-day basis. We also hope that our work can make visible some new pathways for safety and recovery, and that together we can open up opportunities for new collaborations and community partnerships.</p>
      
      
      <b>what we’re doing</b>
      <p>Our entry point into the system is the process for seeking an Order to Surrender Weapons (OTSW) as a component of a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO). These orders can be viewed as a means of mitigating some of the most acute risks of harm for people who have experienced intimate partner violence, and the system in King County is attempting to provide a “culture of compliance” through non-coercive mechanisms. </p>
      
      <p>In the past few months, we’ve been carrying out formative work with community partners, including lawyers, advocates, and law enforcement officials who work on cases of DV. Throughout this process, we’ve been iterating on visual process maps that trace pathways survivors must navigate to obtain DVPOs/OTSWs. As with so many complex systems, even people who are actively working with these cases on a day-to-day basis have a hard time tracking all of the moving pieces. A key challenge in improving these systems and structures is to surface misunderstandings between various actors, and to make the broader context around pain points visible.</p>
      
      <p>We aim to address part of this challenge with the process map visualizations, but we are also <using/considering> this iterative, human-centered design process as a means to better understand the legal system as it currently exists in the context of OTSWs. We’re particularly concerned with supporting the needs people with intersecting vulnerabilities (e.g., people of color, women, people with limited resources, people limited English and/or legal literacy, undocumented people, etc.). Throughout this process, we are committed to designing tools that have practical utility for pressing problems. Additionally, we are committed to documenting our design process in a way that can support future design efforts in contexts where community members are coordinating to build systems of accountability, mutual aid, and care.</p>
      
      <b>call to action/invitation to collaborate</b>
      <p>We realize that our work is just tinkering around the edges of a vast problem, and that there are structural issues that we can’t tackle alone.  We’re working on some pieces of the problem where we see needs that our skills might meet, but we view our larger project as helping expand mechanisms for mapping and building out systems of safety as a community. To that end, we’ll be documenting our work and inviting feedback and collaboration this platform.</p>

      <p>Are you someone who works in this space? Have you been impacted by domestic violence or sexual violence? If you’re interested in sharing your perspective or just joining a conversation about this work, <a href="contact.html" >we would love to hear from you.</a> Intimate partner violence is both personal and structural, and the only path forward that we see is mapping safety for our communities together.</p>
